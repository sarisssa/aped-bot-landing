          Aped is intended to provide users with information and educational
          resources about cryptocurrency trading and sniping features, among
          other things. We do not provide financial or investment advice, and
          users should not rely solely on the information provided by the bot
          when making trading decisions.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-5">
          Aped is not affiliated with any particular cryptocurrency exchange or
          platform. Users should ensure that they trade on the correct DEX /
          platform before attempting to use Aped.

        <li className="mb-5">
          Users should be aware that cryptocurrency trading involves a high
          degree of risk, and that past performance is not necessarily
          indicative of future results. Users should conduct their own research
          and due diligence before making any trades, and should only invest
          funds that they can afford to lose.

        <li className="mb-5">
          By using Aped, users acknowledge that they are solely responsible for
          any trades executed through the bot, and that they assume all risks
          associated with those trades. We are not liable for any losses or
          damages arising from trades executed through the bot.
